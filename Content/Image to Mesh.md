### Simple Benchmark

##### [MeshCNN](https://ranahanocka.github.io/MeshCNN/)
mesh to mesh for segmentation or classification

##### Pixel2Mesh
Image-to-mesh, 3D shape reconstruction, Graph convolutional networks (GCNs)

##### AtlasNet
2D image to 3D mesh, Image-based 3D reconstruction, Parametric surface modeling

##### DeepSDF (Deep Signed Distance Functions)
image -> Distance Functions -> Marching Cubes -> mesh, highlight: smooth, implicit function

##### Occupancy Networks
image -> Occupancy Functions -> Marching Cubes -> mesh; 
Implicit surface learning, 3D reconstruction, Occupancy function;
Generate meshes with arbitrary topology instead of models with fixed topology;
